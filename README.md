Our team is competing for a contract to build, operate, and maintain a fleet of bridge inspection robots for use throughout Indiana. To win the contract, we must design, build, and demonstrate a prototype device for locating, marking, and temporarily patching bridge damage. We will have the opportunity to demonstrate our vehicle on a simulated bridge surface.

Prototype robots will operate on a square plywood surface (roughly 8 ft. x 8 ft.) that has been painted white. Around the perimeter of this white surface will be a black line, positioned approximately 6 in. from the board perimeter. The line will be approximately 3/4 in. in width, and created by applying electrical tape atop the plywood surface.
